                    <p>
In the mid nineties I was immensely lucky to be bequeathed a stunning Nikon FA from my uncle L.Carlos. By that time I was also given some basic photographic lessons from high school and was really keen to put those into practice. I went through that experience with the genuine feeling of who is finding out about something for the really first time: I was spellbound.
