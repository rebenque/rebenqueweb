            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
            In the mid nineties I was immensely lucky to be bequeathed a stunning Nikon FA from my uncle L.Carlos. By that time I was also given some basic photographic lessons from high school and was really keen to put those into practice. I went through that experience with the genuine feeling of who is finding out about something for the really first time: I was spellbound.</p>
            <p>
            I bought a brand new Nikon D300 in 2008. I failed to feel confortable with that machine; the digital process falled far away from my understanding. Until a fellow worker, my gratitude to C.Bautista, came to me and brought himself to open my eyes toward two Spanish masters of the digital media: Mellado and Luijk. The technical foundation of my work is owed to them.</p>
            <p>
            A wonderful iMac computer and Epson printer rounded out my digital laboratory so that I am now able to prepare prints of decent quality up to A3+ size.</p>
            <h2>Extremely unique individuals</h2>
            <p>
            I am pleased to enjoy a great bond of friendship with L.Bedoya who has inspired on countless ocassions with a thrilling inborn sense of aesthetics, talent and sensibility. It is worth having a look at his <a href="http://luisbedoyarubi.blogspot.com.es/" target="_blank">blog</a>.
            <p>N.de Castro really brought my artistic half back to life from a dreadful desease. I am looking forward to resuming our <a href="http://www.myspace.com/heaveninarage" target="_blank">musical</a> communion soon.</p>
            <p>N.Paniagua has showed to me what passion and perseverance is capable of and what the right balance between technique and art should be. And of course what video recording means. <a href="www.youtube.com/user/cromaticatv" target="_blank">Crom&aacute;tica</a> is his legacy.</p>
            <p>Although not having something to do with photography, I am in doubt with <a href="http://www.jsabina.com/" target="_blank"> Joaqu&iacute;n Sabina</a> not only for his albums but for making me realize what I do love of my mother tongue and poetry.</p>
            <p>I would like to thank my brother, <a href="http://ignaciobona.com/" target="_blank">N.Bona</a> who always helps me and hosts this web page.</p>
